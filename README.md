## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am trained in **embedded systems and IoT**, with a strong focus on designing **intelligent software solutions** for data collection, processing, and exploitation.

My work follows a structured technical pipeline:

1. **IoT Data Acquisition**
   Design and implementation of embedded and connected systems for real-time data collection.

2. **Edge, Cloud & Hybrid Architectures**
   Deployment of scalable architectures dedicated to data ingestion, processing, and communication, both on the edge and in the cloud.

3. **Machine Learning for IoT Data**
   Exploitation of collected data using machine learning techniques to extract insights, automate decisions, and optimize system behavior.

4. **RESTful APIs & Backend Services**
   Development of robust APIs to expose data, models, and services to applications and external systems.

I am particularly interested in **real-time systems**, **edge computing**, **autonomous and connected devices**, and **scalable cloud infrastructures**.
